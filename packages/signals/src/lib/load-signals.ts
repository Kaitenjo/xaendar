/**
 * Loads the Signals library by defining the `Signal` global object with the following properties:
 * - `State`: The `State` class for creating reactive state variables.
 * - `Computed`: The `Computed` class for creating derived reactive values.
 * - `Watcher`: The `Watcher` class for observing changes in signals.
 * - `subtle`: An object containing internal utility functions for working with signals, including:
 *  - `untrack`: Executes a function without tracking dependencies.
 *  - `currentComputed`: Returns the currently active `Computed` instance being evaluated, or `null` if none.
 *  - `introspectSources`: Returns the list of sources for a given `Computed` or `Watcher`.
 *  - `introspectSinks`: Returns the list of sinks for a given `State` or `Computed`.
 *  - `hasSinks`: Returns `true` if a given `State` or `Computed` has at least one sink.
 *  - `hasSources`: Returns `true` if a given `Computed` or `Watcher` has at least one source.
 *  - `Watcher`: The `Watcher` class for observing changes in signals.
 * 
 * This function should be called once to initialize the Signals library and make its API available globally.
