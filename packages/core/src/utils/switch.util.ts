/**
 * Creates a reactive switch/case structure by converting it into an if/else-if chain
 * and delegating to {@link _if}.
 *
 * Each case block's condition values are compared against the result of the
 * `expression` function using strict equality (`===`). A block with
 * `condition: null` acts as the `default` branch (mapped to the `else` branch
 * in the underlying if/else-if chain). Multiple values per case are supported
 * (e.g. fall-through cases) and matched with `Array.some`.
 *
 * Because it delegates to `_if`, the switch benefits from the same optimisation:
 * the active branch is only re-rendered when it actually changes.
 *
 * @param parentNode - The parent HTML element where the conditional structure is applied.
 * @param parentContext - The parent Context object containing all the variables definition from the Parent Closure
 * @param expression - Function that evaluates the switch expression. Called
 *   reactively inside an effect so that signal reads are tracked.
 * @param blocks - Ordered list of case branches. Each entry contains:
 *   - `condition`: array of values to match against the expression result,
 *     or `null` for the default branch.
 *   - `block`: function that applies the branch's side effects and returns
 *     its cleanup functions.
