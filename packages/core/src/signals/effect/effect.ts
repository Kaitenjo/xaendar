/**
 * Runs a side-effectful function and automatically re-runs it whenever any
 * Signal read during its execution changes.
 *
 * Internally, `effect` wraps the user callback inside a `Computed` node
 * (for dependency tracking) and observes it with a `Watcher` (for push
 * notifications). When any tracked dependency changes, the `Watcher`
 * schedules a microtask that re-evaluates the `Computed`, which in turn
 * re-runs the user callback and re-registers the new set of dependencies.
 *
 * The returned disposer function stops the effect: it unwatches the internal
 * `Computed` from the `Watcher`, severing all dependency subscriptions so
 * the callback is never called again and the graph nodes can be
 * garbage-collected.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const count = new State(0);
 *
 * const stop = effect(() => {
 *   console.log('count is', count.get());
 * });
 * // logs: "count is 0"
 *
 * count.set(1); // logs: "count is 1"
 * count.set(2); // logs: "count is 2"
 *
 * stop();       // no more logs
 * count.set(3); // silent
 * ```
 *
 * Effects created synchronously inside the `onInit` hook of a component or a directive
 * are disposed automatically when it is destroyed: there is no need to keep the disposer.
 * The disposer returned in that case can still be called manually, and more than once.
 * Effects created anywhere else (constructor, after an `await`, in a listener, ...)
 * must be disposed manually.
 *
 * @param fn - The side-effectful function to run. Any Signal read inside it
 *   is tracked as a dependency.
 * @returns A disposer function that, when called, permanently stops the effect.
